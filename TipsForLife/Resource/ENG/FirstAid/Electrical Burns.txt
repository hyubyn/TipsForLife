Electrical burns may be caused by a number of sources of electricity, such as lightning, stun guns and contact with household current. You may treat minor electrical burns as you would other minor burns.

* When to contact your doctor

A person who has been injured by contact with electricity should be seen by a doctor. Sometimes an electrical injury can cause damage to internal tissues, usually in an arm or a leg. The damage may be worse than one would expect from the burn on the skin.

* Caution

	- Don't touch the injured person if he or she is still in contact with the electrical current.
	- Call 911 or your local emergency number if the source of the burn is a high-voltage wire or lightning. Don't get near high-voltage wires until the power is turned off. Overhead power lines usually aren't insulated. Stay at least 20 feet (about 6 meters) away â€” farther if wires are jumping and sparking.
	- Don't move a person with an electrical injury unless the person is in immediate danger.

* When to seek emergency care

Call 911 or your local emergency number if the injured person experiences:

	- Severe burns
	- Confusion
	- Difficulty breathing
	- Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)
	- Cardiac arrest
	- Muscle pain and contractions
	- Seizures
	- Loss of consciousness

Take these actions immediately while waiting for medical help:

	- Turn off the source of electricity if possible. If not, move the source away from both you and the injured person using a dry, nonconducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood.
	- Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.
	- Try to prevent the injured person from becoming chilled.
	- Apply a bandage. Cover any burned areas with a sterile gauze bandage, if available, or a clean cloth. Don't use a blanket or towel, because loose fibers can stick to the burns.
