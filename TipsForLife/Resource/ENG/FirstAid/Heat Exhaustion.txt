Heat exhaustion is one of the heat-related syndromes. Symptoms range in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion to potentially life-threatening heatstroke. Heat exhaustion can begin suddenly, usually after working or playing in the heat, perspiring heavily or being dehydrated.

Heat exhaustion signs and symptoms include:

	- Faintness or dizziness
	- Nausea or vomiting
	- Heavy sweating often accompanied by cold, clammy skin
	- Weak, rapid pulse
	- Pale or flushed face
	- Muscle cramps
	- Headache
	- Weakness or fatigue

If you suspect heat exhaustion

Untreated, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, which is a life-threatening condition. If you suspect heat exhaustion, take these steps immediately:

	- Move the person out of the heat and into a shady or air-conditioned place.
	- Lay the person down and elevate the legs and feet slightly.
	- Remove tight or heavy clothing.
	- Have the person drink cool water or other nonalcoholic beverage without caffeine.
	- Cool the person by spraying or sponging with cool water and fanning.
	- Monitor the person carefully.

Call 911 or your local emergency number if the person's condition deteriorates, especially if he or she experiences:

	- Fainting
	- Confusion
	- Seizures
	- Fever of 104 F (40 C) or greater
